DDD-CQRS Base Project Using Spring and Hibernate

## Introduction ##

### Why poke around this project ? ###

Because it aims to provide out of the box building blocks to implement [DDD](http://domaindrivendesign.org/resources/what_is_ddd).

Because it aims to provide out of the box components to implement [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)

Because you will not have to look into things like DB Connectivity,Transaction and Logging Configuration,Unit/Integration Test setup/configuration.

Just check out the project,and add your business logic as simple as that !!, An addition to this you also get two sample applications embedded, which tell you how you should be writing your code using the components present in the framework, if you do not want them later (Production release), Just delete them off :)

Still not convinced pop into

This project has been greatly influenced by

http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-sample/

The Leaven project has excellent documentation and is a great place to begin looking at how a CQRS-DDD project should be implemented.

This project tries to follow in the same spirit, with a one primary difference

1) [BE MORE COMPLETE](http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-base-project/wiki/Objectives)

I realize that this cannot be measured :)

However i do not want everyone to be concerned with things like security configuration,logging configuration,pulling in requisite jars and so on !!
